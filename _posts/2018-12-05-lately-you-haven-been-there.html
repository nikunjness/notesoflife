<p dir="ltr">Remember how we used to hangout together? <br>Remember those two cups of cutting tea and that dark corner? <br>How we used to look at the flowing traffic on the road,<br>The toy seller kid, the bragging biker, and everything deserving this ode,<br></p><p dir="ltr">It was not long time ago, <br>but things have changed lately, <br>Neither the dark corner is there,<br>Nor the two cups of cutting tea, </p><p dir="ltr">The kid isn't selling toys anymore, <br>The traffic is still there but looking at it is not a joy anymore, </p><p dir="ltr">I see new places popping out,<br>Shining lights and unmanageable crowd,<br>The talk isn't happening anymore,<br>All you can hear is music loud,</p><p dir="ltr">I looked for that corner,<br>and I looked for that kid everywhere,<br>Hoping that he would be on the streets somewhere,<br>Do you realise lately you haven't been there? </p><p dir="ltr">I craved for answers and I craved for philosophical stories, <br>No one to share sadness with, No one to celebrate glories, <br>No one to tell me that they care, <br>Do you realise lately you haven't been there? </p><p dir="ltr">~ Nikunj Thakkar</p>
