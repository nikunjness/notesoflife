<p>One day when I woke up that bright spotlight was gone, <br />
I felt like being trapped in a dark zone,<br />
While I was sitting there staring at the blank,<br />
It felt like I was on the Titanic and the ship had just sank</p>

<p>Don't tell me you never felt this way,<br />
Don't tell me you never had a rough day,<br />
I know some days you just hope that it'll pass,<br />
And on other days you give up and rely on glass,</p>

<p>Numbing yourself to take the pain away, <br />
Oblivion is the only gateway,<br />
Wake up, blame yourself,<br />
Take a guilt trip, to the point you withstand</p>

<p>How long until it's all void?<br />
What you're trying to build is already destroyed,<br />
Look on the other side of the mirror,<br />
Why does it feel queer?</p>

<p><br />Is it real? Look outside the window,<br />
Tell me something that I already don't know,<br />
Knock Knock, who's there? Reality.<br />
Reality who? A reality that just hit you hard,<br />
You lost the game while holding all your cards,</p>

<p>Stop the argument, you've lost the case,<br />
Nothing to replace and nothing to retrace,<br />
The world is chaos and life is a mess, <br />
All I'm left with is nothingness.</p><br />
