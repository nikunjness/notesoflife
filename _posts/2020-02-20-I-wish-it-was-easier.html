<p>I wish it was easier,<br>
    to be there everyday, <br>
    to keep dreaming and believing,<br>
    that some day it would change, would it?</p>
    
    <p>I wish it was easier,<br>
    to not doubt,<br>
    to not kill yourself over it,<br>
    that someday you will make it, will you?</p>
    
    <p>I wish it was easier,<br>
    to put on a mask,<br>
    to pretend that everything is great, <br>
    that someday it will be real, will it?</p>
    
    <p>I wish it was easier,<br>
    to change the world,<br>
    to be happier than ever,<br>
    that someday it will be a better place, will it?</p>
    
    <p>I wish it was easier, <br>
    to face the failure,<br>
    to start over and over,<br>
    that someday you will succeed, will you?</p>
    
    <p>I wish it was easier, <br>
    to fulfil the wishes that you have, and <br>
    to have a fewer wishes, <br>
    that someday it will be enough, will it?</p>
    
    <p>I could only wish, <br>
    to have you moved by this poem,<br>
    to make you put your plan in action,<br>
    that someday you will make it too. Yes, you will.</p>
