<p>A room full of people, listening to whatever being said,<br />There I see her sitting in the front row, feeling like she should be somewhere instead,</p>
<p>A few moments passes by and we look into eachother's eyes,<br />Does the moment stop or the time flies?</p>
<p>One moment I'm looking at the audience and one moment I'm looking at her,<br />Somewhere deep down I knew what all the possibilities were,</p>
<p>I build up the courage and wait for the break,<br />What are the chances that her number I could take?</p>
<p>Mind works hard and comes up with a plan,<br />Is it something that heart really wants?</p>
<p>There we're talking and the plan works out,<br />Silly! What were you worried about?</p>
<p>Days passes by and life gets busy,<br />Did you think finding time was that easy?</p>
<p>Finally a day is locked and the place is Dark Roast,<br />Conversation was great but it was her smile that I liked most,</p>
<p>I look into her eyes when she tells her stories,<br />She chuckles, takes pauses, settles her hair - glories!</p>
<p>A scary, horror scene at the movies gets her frightened,<br />I wish we hold hands and each time the scene was on it was tightened</p>
<p>I'm sometimes confused coz bitter past experiences and lies,<br />She takes out the worries and assures me with her replies,</p>
<p>She goes through the trouble and acts like nothing, <br />Blink of her eye, that little smile feels like everything, <br /><br />I wish she behaves like a rain and falls for me, <br />Life says - kid, it's a good story, but will she?<br /><br />~ Nikunj Thakkar</p>
