<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u><b>There's more to it </b></u></h2><br />You'll go by words but there's more to it,<br />You'll go by expressions but there's more to it,<br />You'll always complain, this isn't enough,<br />I will smile and say there's more to it<br /><br />You'll see the sunshine,<br />You'll enjoy the view bright,<br />Flowers will be at peak of their blossom,<br />view from the window will be always awesome,<br />still you'll always complain, this isn't enough,<br />I will smile and say there's more to it<br /><br />Train journeys will seem boring,<br />Uncle on the other seat will irritate you with his snoring,<br />Mountains, rivers, villages and farms will try to make you chill,<br />I'll ask “why are you still in the mood to kill?”,<br />You'll always complain, this isn't enough,<br />I will smile and say there's more to it<br /><br />No matter how hard you try,<br />I'm not gonna let you cry,<br />I know this isn't enough,<br />there's always more to it, there's always more to it.</div><br /><div style="text-align: right;">- Nikunj Thakkar    </div></div>
