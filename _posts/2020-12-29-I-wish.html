<p>I wish I could tell you things I never told anyone,<br />
It pains me out that things that are done can not be undone,<br />
Wasn't it yesterday when this story had just begun?<br />
Now I see a good hearted person and tell them you remind me of someone,</p>

<p>I wish I could make this feeling go away,<br />
Go back to times when everything was okay,<br />
Was it ever the case? Or that's how they just say,<br />
Good old times is how they portray,</p>


<p>I wish I get to meet you once before it's too late, <br />
Trust me dear, it's not a matter of fate, <br />
Was it real? will it work? We can debate,<br />
A happy ending is what makes a story great,</p> 

<p>I wish we could travel together,</br> 
Talk about childhood, share stories and make memories that matter, <br />
May be write a postcard to ourselves and read it later,<br />
Isn't it the best way to know a person better?</p>

<p>I wish I could write things in this poem that touches your heart,<br />
If I can't convey a simple message, is poetry even an art?<br />
I struggle to find out ways to fix this broken part,<br />
I dream of the day when you will come back, smile and say - Let's have a fresh start.</p>
