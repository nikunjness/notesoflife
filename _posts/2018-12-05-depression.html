<p dir="ltr"><u><u>Are</u></u> you Depressed?<br>She asked. </p><p dir="ltr">So many glanced,<br>No one answered. </p><p dir="ltr">But to some it touched,<br>Deeper than they thought,<br>Brought memories, stories, incidents<br>painful, fearful and what not. </p><p dir="ltr">Can you face this?<br>Without loosing the only thing you&#8217;re hanging on to.</p><p dir="ltr">It might not be easier,<br>but sure it is the wiser,<br>if you&#8217;re reading this, <br>must know that there&#8217;s someone<br>to lend an ear</p><p dir="ltr">The smiles are fake,<br>Hollow those loud cheer,<br>illusion is what they surrounded with themselves<br>if you touch the soul,<br>the pain is sheer</p><p dir="ltr">But worry not oh my dear,<br>lonely you may feel,<br>think, isn&#8217;t it easier to kill? <br>There will be always one to say,<br>Wait! I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m here. </p><p dir="ltr">~ Nikunj Thakkar</p>
