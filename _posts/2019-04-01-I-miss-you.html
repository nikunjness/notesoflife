<p>"I missed you", The text said.<br />I read it lying on my bed,<br />It brought back memories,<br />I presumed to be dead.</p>
<p>Why me? Why now?<br />Not able to digest it somehow,<br />I wonder if it was this or it was that,<br />All my reasoning come crashing flat,</p>
<p>Crafting theories as I have reasons to find,<br />Running facts again and again in my mind,<br />Am I over thinking? Or is it this drinking?<br />Should I sleep over it and let it unwind?</p>
<p>Theories were crafted,<br />Assumptions were made, <br />Some were meaningful some were lame,<br />A simple message turned out to be interesting then a chess game,</p>
<p>Nothing worked out and I picked up myself,<br />"I missed you too" I said, thinking how bad it could get,<br />We talked day and night, had laughs and fight,<br />As we realised dodging our biggest regret,</p>
<p>Now she annoys me sometimes, <br />But she's the best partner in crime, <br />In the darkest of the day when everything falls through, <br />I look at my phone and smile, the message still says "I missed you".<br /><br />~ Nikunj Thakkar</p>
